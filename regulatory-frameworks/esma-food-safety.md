# Emirates Authority for Standardization and Metrology (ESMA) - Food Safety Division

**Authority**: ESMA Food Safety Division
**Scope**: HACCP certification, food facility licensing, hygiene inspections, food import/export compliance
**Website**: https://www.esma.gov.ae

## Applicability Trigger

ESMA regulations apply to **any commercial property** intended for:
- Food manufacturing (bakeries, confectioneries, beverage production)
- Central kitchens (catering operations, hotel commissaries)
- Food processing (meat cutting, produce packaging, cold storage)
- Food warehousing (temperature-controlled storage for perishables)
- Restaurants, cafes, food courts (if >50 sq m kitchen area)

**Critical**: Even if food is not the primary business, properties with employee cafeterias, catering kitchens, or food service areas require ESMA compliance.

## HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) Certification

### What is HACCP?
Internationally recognized food safety management system that identifies, evaluates, and controls hazards from biological, chemical, or physical contamination.

### HACCP Certification Timeline
- **Initial Application**: 2-3 weeks (document review)
- **Facility Inspection**: 1 week (ESMA auditor site visit)
- **Corrective Actions**: 2-4 weeks (if deficiencies found)
- **Certification Issuance**: 1 week
- **Total**: **8-12 weeks** (if no major deficiencies)

### HACCP Requirements by Facility Type

#### Central Kitchens (e.g., ADNH Catering Al Quoz facility)
- **Production capacity documentation**: Daily meal output, storage capacity
- **Temperature control zones**:
  - Cold storage: 0-4°C (walk-in refrigerators)
  - Freezer storage: -18°C or below
  - Hot holding: 60°C+ (for prepared meals)
  - Cooking zones: 75°C+ internal temperature
- **Separate zones for**:
  - Raw material receiving
  - Preparation (vegetable washing, meat cutting)
  - Cooking
  - Cooling
  - Packaging
  - Dispatch
- **Staff facilities**: Changing rooms, handwashing stations (1 per 10 workers), shoe sanitization
- **Pest control**: Monthly contracted service, documentation required
- **Waste management**: Separate bins for food waste, recyclables, general waste; daily collection

#### Food Manufacturing Plants
- **Process flow documentation**: Ingredient → Processing → Packaging → Storage
- **Allergen control**: Separate production lines or validated cleaning protocols
- **Metal detection**: Inline metal detectors for packaged products
- **Water quality testing**: Quarterly lab analysis (potable water standards)
- **Equipment calibration**: Annual calibration certificates for thermometers, scales, metal detectors

#### Cold Storage Warehouses
- **Temperature monitoring**: Automated sensors with 24/7 logging
- **Backup power**: Generators to maintain cold chain during outages
- **Alarm systems**: Temperature deviation alerts (SMS/email to facility manager)
- **Stock rotation**: FIFO (First In, First Out) protocols
- **Product traceability**: Barcode/RFID tracking from receipt to dispatch

### HACCP Inspection Checklist (60 Points)

ESMA inspectors score facilities on 60 criteria:

| **Equipment calibration** | AED 10,000 (thermometers, scales, detectors) |
| **Total Annual Compliance** | **AED 76,000 - 101,000** |

## Common Deficiencies Found in Dubai Food Facilities

1. **Temperature control failures** (45% of facilities) - Inadequate refrigeration capacity or broken sensors
2. **Staff hygiene violations** (30%) - No hair nets, jewelry worn, dirty uniforms
3. **Cross-contamination risks** (20%) - Raw and cooked foods stored together
4. **Documentation gaps** (15%) - Missing temperature logs, no staff training records
5. **Pest evidence** (10%) - Rodent droppings, insect activity, inadequate exclusion measures

## ESMA Inspection Frequency

- **High-risk facilities** (central kitchens >2,000 meals/day): **Quarterly inspections** (4x/year)
- **Medium-risk** (food manufacturing, cold storage): **Biannual inspections** (2x/year)
- **Low-risk** (restaurants, small cafes): **Annual inspections** (1x/year)

**Critical**: Unannounced inspections can occur at any time. Facilities must maintain 24/7 compliance.

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

- **Minor violations** (missing temperature log for 1 day): **AED 1,000 - 5,000** fine
- **Major violations** (no staff health certificates): **AED 10,000 - 50,000** fine + suspension threat
- **Critical violations** (foodborne illness outbreak linked to facility): **AED 100,000 - 500,000** fine + license revocation + criminal prosecution

## ESMA Pre-Approval Consultation Service

ESMA offers **free pre-approval consultations** for new facilities:
- Email: foodsafety@esma.gov.ae
- Phone: +971-2-563-3333
- Service: 1-hour on-site visit to identify potential compliance gaps **before** formal application
- Recommendation: **Always use this service** for new central kitchen/food manufacturing projects (saves 4-8 weeks and AED 50K+ in rework)

## Best Practices for Fast-Track ESMA Approval

1. **Hire ESMA-approved consultant** (AED 50K-100K, but reduces timeline by 50%)
2. **Submit complete documentation** (HACCP plan, floor plans, equipment specs) in first application
3. **Schedule pre-inspection walkthrough** (identify issues before official audit)
4. **Install automated monitoring systems** (temperature sensors, alarm systems) upfront
5. **Train staff before inspection** (ESMA tests random workers on food safety knowledge)

## ADNH Catering Case Study: Al Quoz Central Kitchen

**Facility Scale**: 10,000 sq m, 367,000 meals/day, 200+ staff

**ESMA Compliance Costs**:
- **Initial HACCP certification**: AED 90,000 (consultant + inspection fees)
- **Facility upgrades**: AED 2.1M (refrigeration, flooring, ventilation, monitoring systems)
- **Annual license**: AED 40,000
- **Annual compliance**: AED 250,000 (pest control, training, testing, calibration)
- **Total Year 1**: **AED 2.48M**
- **Total Annual (Years 2+)**: **AED 290,000**

**Timeline**: 8-12 weeks from application to certification (assuming facility already built to ESMA standards)

## Red Flags to Avoid

- ❌ **Starting food operations before HACCP approval** (immediate shutdown order + AED 100K+ fine)
- ❌ **Using non-stainless steel equipment** (ESMA rejects - aluminum, plastic not allowed in food zones)
- ❌ **Insufficient cold storage** (leads to temperature excursions, product spoilage, failed audits)
- ❌ **No backup power for refrigeration** (ESMA requires generators for facilities >1,000 meals/day)

**Bottom Line**: ESMA compliance is **non-negotiable** for food facilities. Budget 8-12 weeks and AED 90K-4M (depending on facility size and readiness) before any food production can commence.
