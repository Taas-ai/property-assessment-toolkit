# Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) - Utility Connection Requirements

**Authority**: Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA)
**Scope**: Electrical power connection, water/sewage infrastructure, district cooling, solar energy compliance
**Website**: https://www.dewa.gov.ae

## Applicability

DEWA connection is **mandatory** for:
- All new commercial, industrial, and residential buildings
- Existing buildings undergoing major renovations (>30% of electrical load change)
- Properties requiring load increases >100 kW
- Buildings >10,000 sq m (district cooling mandatory)
- All rooftop solar installations (Shams Dubai program)

**Critical**: No occupancy permit issued without DEWA final connection and metering.

## Electrical Power Connection Process

### Step 1: Load Calculation & Application (1-2 weeks)

**Required Load Estimation**:
- **Office buildings**: 40-50 watts per sq m
- **Retail/shopping centers**: 60-80 watts per sq m
- **Industrial/warehouse**: 30-40 watts per sq m
- **Central kitchens/food processing**: 100-150 watts per sq m (high refrigeration + cooking loads)
- **Hotels**: 80-100 watts per sq m

**ADNH Catering Al Quoz Example** (10,000 sq m central kitchen):
- Load estimate: 10,000 sq m × 120 W/sq m = **1,200 kW (1.2 MW)**
- Peak demand with safety factor (1.25×): **1,500 kW**

**Application Documents**:
- Dubai Municipality approved building plans
- Electrical load calculations (signed by licensed electrical engineer)
- Single-line diagram (showing main switchboard, transformers, distribution panels)
- Plot ownership proof or tenancy contract

### Step 2: DEWA Capacity Assessment (2-4 weeks)

DEWA checks **grid capacity** at nearest substation:
- ✅ **Adequate capacity**: DEWA approves connection, assigns reference number
- ⚠️ **Limited capacity**: DEWA requires **customer-funded substation upgrade** (see costs below)
- ❌ **No capacity**: DEWA denies connection until new substation built (6-12 months lead time)

**Al Quoz Industrial Area Grid Status** (as of 2024):
- **Al Quoz 1-2**: ✅ Adequate capacity for loads up to 2 MW
- **Al Quoz 3-4**: ⚠️ Limited capacity, upgrades required for >500 kW loads
- **ADNH Catering Plot 327-1156 (Al Quoz 3)**: **Likely requires upgrade contribution** (AED 1.5M-2.5M estimate)

### Step 3: Infrastructure Design & Approval (4-6 weeks)

**High-Tension (HT) Connection** (for loads >500 kW):
- Customer must build **11kV substation** on-site
- Substation components:
  - Ring Main Unit (RMU) for DEWA feeder connection
  - Power transformer (11kV primary / 400V secondary)
  - Medium-voltage switchgear
  - Protection relays and SCADA system
  - Battery backup for control systems

**Low-Tension (LT) Connection** (for loads <500 kW):
- Direct 400V connection from DEWA distribution transformer
- Customer provides main distribution board (MDB) only

**ADNH Catering (1.5 MW load)**: Requires **HT connection + 2 transformers** (800 kVA each for redundancy)

### Step 4: Construction & Inspection (8-12 weeks, concurrent with building construction)

**Electrical Infrastructure Installation**:
- Underground cable trenches (from DEWA substation to customer site)
- Customer substation construction (if HT connection)
- Internal distribution panels, wiring, earthing systems
- Emergency generator installation (mandatory for food facilities, hospitals, data centers)

**DEWA Inspections**:
1. **Cable trench inspection**: Before backfilling trenches
2. **Substation rough-in inspection**: Before energization
3. **Pre-commissioning inspection**: All equipment installed, tested
4. **Final inspection**: DEWA witnesses load testing, protection relay settings

### Step 5: Connection & Metering (1-2 weeks)

- DEWA installs revenue meters (HT customers get CT-metered 11kV meters)
- DEWA energizes connection
- Customer completes commissioning (load testing, generator synchronization)
- DEWA issues **Electricity Supply Completion Certificate** (required for occupancy permit)

**Total Electrical Connection Timeline**:
- **LT connection (<500 kW)**: 8-12 weeks
- **HT connection (>500 kW, adequate grid capacity)**: 12-16 weeks
- **HT connection (grid upgrade required)**: 20-30 weeks

## Electrical Connection Costs

## Water & Sewage Connection

### Water Connection Process (Similar timeline to electrical)

**Step 1: Application** (1 week)
- Submit water demand estimate (liters per day)
- Office: 50 liters/person/day
- Retail: 30 liters/person/day
- Industrial: Varies (20-100 liters/person/day)
- **Central kitchen**: **200-300 liters per meal produced** (high water use for cooking, cleaning, sanitation)

**ADNH Catering (367,000 meals/day)**:
- Water demand: 367,000 meals × 250 liters/meal = **91,750,000 liters/day (91,750 cubic meters/day)**
- This is **extremely high** - likely requires **dedicated water main from DEWA reservoir**

**Step 2: DEWA Water Network Assessment** (2-3 weeks)
- DEWA checks water main capacity in area
- If inadequate, customer funds main extension/upgrade

**Step 3: Connection & Metering** (4-6 weeks)
- DEWA installs water meter (for properties <100 cu m/day)
- Large users (>100 cu m/day) get **bulk metered connection with flow sensors**

**Water Connection Fees**:
- Standard commercial: AED 2,000 - 10,000
- Large industrial/food facility: AED 50,000 - 200,000 (depends on flow rate)

**ADNH Catering**: **AED 150,000** (high-volume connection)

### Sewage Connection

**Sewage Flow Estimate**: 80-90% of water consumption
- ADNH Catering: 91,750 cu m/day water × 0.85 = **78,000 cu m/day sewage**

**Sewage Fees**:
- Included in water tariff (35% of water bill)
- No separate connection fee for properties connected to municipal sewage network

**Critical for Food Facilities**: **Grease trap required** before sewage discharge
- Size: 1,000-5,000 liter capacity (depends on kitchen scale)
- Cost: AED 15,000 - 50,000 (equipment + installation)
- DEWA inspects grease trap before final approval

**ADNH Catering**: **5,000-liter grease trap** (AED 50,000)

## District Cooling Connection (Mandatory for >10,000 sq m Buildings)

### What is District Cooling?
Centralized chilled water production + distribution network (more efficient than individual building chillers).

**District Cooling Providers in Dubai**:
- **Empower** (largest, covers Business Bay, Dubai Marina, JLT)
- **Tabreed** (covers Downtown Dubai, DIFC)
- **Emicool** (covers parts of Al Quoz, Jumeirah)

**Al Quoz Industrial Area 3**: **No district cooling available** (industrial area, not prioritized)
- ADNH Catering must install **on-site chiller plant** for air conditioning

### On-Site Chiller Plant Costs (Alternative to District Cooling)

**For 10,000 sq m central kitchen**:
- Cooling load: 10,000 sq m × 150 W/sq m ÷ 3.5 kW/ton = **430 tons refrigeration (TR)**
- Chiller plant components:
  - 2× 250 TR chillers (N+1 redundancy): AED 600,000
  - Cooling towers: AED 150,000
  - Pumps + piping: AED 200,000
  - Chilled water distribution: AED 300,000
  - **Total**: **AED 1.25M**

**Ongoing Costs**:
- Electricity for chillers: AED 80,000 - 120,000/month (high energy consumption)
- Maintenance: AED 60,000/year

## DEWA Tariffs (2024 Rates)

### Electricity Tariffs (Commercial)

| Monthly Consumption | Rate per kWh | Fuel Surcharge | Total |
|---------------------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| **0-2,000 kWh** | AED 0.23 | AED 0.065 | AED 0.295/kWh |
| **2,001-4,000 kWh** | AED 0.28 | AED 0.065 | AED 0.345/kWh |
| **4,001-6,000 kWh** | AED 0.32 | AED 0.065 | AED 0.385/kWh |
| **>6,000 kWh** | AED 0.38 | AED 0.065 | AED 0.445/kWh |

**High-Tension (HT) Industrial Rate** (for loads >500 kW):
- **Energy charge**: AED 0.32/kWh
- **Demand charge**: AED 35/kW/month (based on peak monthly demand)
- **Fuel surcharge**: AED 0.065/kWh

**ADNH Catering Monthly Electricity Cost** (1,500 kW, 80% load factor, 24/7 operation):
- Energy consumption: 1,500 kW × 0.80 × 720 hours/month = 864,000 kWh
- Energy charge: 864,000 × AED 0.32 = AED 276,480
- Demand charge: 1,500 kW × AED 35 = AED 52,500
- Fuel surcharge: 864,000 × AED 0.065 = AED 56,160
- **Total**: **AED 385,140/month** (**AED 4.6M/year**)

### Water Tariffs (Commercial)

| Monthly Consumption | Rate per Imperial Gallon | Rate per Cubic Meter |
|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **0-10,000 gal** | AED 0.035 | AED 7.70 |
| **>10,000 gal** | AED 0.041 | AED 9.02 |

**ADNH Catering Monthly Water Cost**:
- Water consumption: 91,750 cu m/day × 30 days = 2,752,500 cu m/month
- Water charge: 2,752,500 × AED 9.02 = **AED 24.8M/month**
- Sewage charge (35% of water): AED 8.7M/month
- **Total Water/Sewage**: **AED 33.5M/month** (**AED 402M/year**)

**Critical**: This water consumption is **extremely high** - likely an error in meal production estimate or water usage factor. Typical central kitchens use 50-100 liters/meal, not 250 liters/meal.

**Revised ADNH Catering Water Estimate** (using 75 liters/meal):
- 367,000 meals/day × 75 liters = 27,525 cu m/day
- Monthly: 825,750 cu m
- Water charge: AED 7.4M/month
- Sewage: AED 2.6M/month
- **Total**: **AED 10M/month** (**AED 120M/year**)

## Shams Dubai (Rooftop Solar Program)

### Mandatory Solar Installation (as of 2024)

**Buildings required to install solar**:
- All new commercial buildings >10,000 sq m
- Existing buildings undergoing major renovations

**Solar Capacity Requirement**: **5% of building's peak electrical load**

**ADNH Catering (1,500 kW peak load)**:
- Required solar: 1,500 kW × 0.05 = **75 kW solar PV**
- Rooftop area needed: 75 kW ÷ 0.15 kW/sq m = 500 sq m
- **Cost**: AED 4,000/kW × 75 kW = **AED 300,000**

**Solar Incentives**:
- DEWA pays **AED 0.18/kWh** for excess solar generation exported to grid
- Typical payback: 8-10 years

## DEWA Approval Timeline Summary

| Service | Timeline |
|---------|----------|
| **LT electrical connection (<500 kW)** | 8-12 weeks |
| **HT electrical connection (>500 kW)** | 12-16 weeks |
| **HT with grid upgrade** | 20-30 weeks |
| **Water connection (standard)** | 4-6 weeks |
| **Water connection (high-volume)** | 8-12 weeks |
| **District cooling (if available)** | 12-16 weeks |
| **Shams Dubai solar approval** | 6-8 weeks |

## Common DEWA Deficiencies

1. **Undersized substation** (30% of HT applications) - Customer calculates load incorrectly, transformer too small
2. **Missing grease trap** (20% of food facilities) - DEWA rejects sewage connection without grease trap
3. **Inadequate earthing system** (15%) - Earth resistance >1 ohm (DEWA requires <1 ohm)
4. **No emergency generator** (10% of critical facilities) - Food facilities, hospitals, data centers must have backup power
5. **Solar compliance failure** (5%) - Buildings >10,000 sq m without 5% solar capacity

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

- **Operating without DEWA connection**: **AED 50,000** fine + immediate disconnection of any temporary supply
- **Theft of electricity** (bypassing meter): **AED 100,000** fine + criminal prosecution + bill for estimated consumption
- **Grease discharge into sewage** (without grease trap): **AED 10,000** fine per incident + mandatory grease trap installation
- **Exceeding contracted load** (>10% over): **AED 5,000** fine + forced load upgrade to higher tariff tier

## Best Practices for Fast-Track DEWA Approval

1. **Apply early** (start DEWA application as soon as Dubai Municipality preliminary NOC received)
2. **Over-provision transformer capacity** (size for 125% of calculated load to allow future expansion)
3. **Coordinate with DEWA project manager** (DEWA assigns PM for loads >1 MW - use them for questions)
4. **Install redundancy** (N+1 transformers, dual feeders - reduces downtime risk, DEWA approves faster)
5. **Pre-qualify electrical contractor** (use DEWA-approved contractor list - ensures first-time inspection passes)

## Red Flags to Avoid

- ❌ **Delaying DEWA application** (DEWA is critical path - delays here push building completion by months)
- ❌ **Underestimating grid upgrade costs** (AED 1-2M surprise if substation capacity insufficient)
- ❌ **Skipping emergency generator** (DEWA requires generator for food facilities - add AED 300K-500K if forgotten)
- ❌ **Ignoring solar requirement** (buildings >10,000 sq m without 5% solar = DEWA connection denied)
